The run_analysis.R file computes various fitness-related metrics, namely mean and standard deviation, for many users based on 2000+ metrics.  The  
Data are stored in a "tidy" format.  The README file described within the CodeBook in this repo contains links to more information
about the data analyzed in run_analysis.R.

Within R, the data frames are (1) X, (2) Y, and (3) subjects, all of which use both training and testing data.  
The "tidy" column names for X are stored in a data frame called "features," with other data frames
